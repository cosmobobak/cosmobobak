## Hi! I'm Cosmo, the author of [the UK's strongest chess program](https://github.com/cosmobobak/viridithas).
I'm interested in chess, reinforcement learning, neural networks, machine learning more generally, and I'm a big fan of the Rust programming language.

I'd recommend you check out some of my favourite projects:
- first and foremost, [Viridithas](https://github.com/cosmobobak/viridithas), my chess-playing program, which competes at the [Top Chess Engine Competition](https://tcec-chess.com/) and chess.com's [Computer Chess Championship](https://www.chess.com/computer-chess-championship), and places highly on many public rating lists, such as
  - The Computer Chess Rating List ([40/15](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/4040/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?class=Single-CPU+engines&only_best_in_class=on&num_best_in_class=1&print=Rating+list), [Blitz](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?class=Single-CPU+engines&only_best_in_class=on&num_best_in_class=1&print=Rating+list), and [Chess960](https://www.computerchess.org.uk/ccrl/404FRC/cgi/compare_engines.cgi?class=Single-CPU+engines&only_best_in_class=on&num_best_in_class=1&print=Rating+list))
  - [Stefan Pohl's Computer Chess](https://www.sp-cc.de/)
  - [Ipmanchess](https://ipmanchess.yolasite.com/r9-7945hx.php)
- [iridium-oxide](https://github.com/cosmobobak/iridium-oxide), a general game playing program (GGP) using Monte-Carlo Tree Search.
- [rustbrot](https://github.com/cosmobobak/rustbrot), a mandlebrot set renderer using Rust's support for easy bug-free multithreading.
- my [variable-size sudoku solver](https://github.com/cosmobobak/rust-sudoku) which can solve 4x4, 9x9, 16x16, and 25x25 sudokus.
- [wikipath](https://github.com/cosmobobak/wikipath), a program that plays the Wikipedia Speedrun game, using levenshtein distance and word2vec cosine similarity.
